# FOForth
A Matlab solver for optimization problems with orthogonality constraints.
## Problems
This solver is to solve the following problem,
> min h(X)+trace(G'X),
  s.t.  X'X=I,
  
  where X is n-by-p matrix, and h(X) is orthogonal invariant (h(XQ)=h(X) for any orthogonal matrix Q) and satisfies \nabla h(X)=H(X)X.
